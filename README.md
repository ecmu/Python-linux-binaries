# Python linux binaries
Build linux binaries for [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython).

Please note that this recipe is for my personal use. 
This is done with Ubuntu 20.04. I believe that should work with many recent linux distributions, but it has not been verified.
I will not post binaries for each version of python sources, only versions useful for my personal needs...

## Notes

See python wrapper script in binary root for usage.
